# Design-Patterns
A few small java programs created using the Command, Prototype, Observer, Flyweight, State, and Singleton desing patterns.
Also uses the java swing GUI library.

COMMAND:<br>
Paints random shapes to the screen using the command pattern.<br>
The shapes can be undone or redone aswell using this pattern.<br>

<br>
<br>
PROTOTYPE:<br>
Generates three random "fish" that move freely around in a fish tank.<br>
You can select one of these fish and clone them using the Prototype pattern.<br>
Cloning the fish will create another identical one.<br>

OBSERVER:<br>
I honestly don't remember how this one works at all.<br>
Nor do I remember what it even does.<br>

<br>
<br>
FLYWEIGHT:<br>
Generates "terrain" in two different ways depending on which button is clicked.<br>
The fast button generates it with the flyweight pattern.<br>
The slow button generates it the way I would have done it before using this pattern.<br>
The time it took to generate each is recorded and displayed beside the buttons.<br>

STATE & SINGLETON:<br>
A music player where you can select a song from the top menu.<br>
(Does not actually play any music, but merely counts down the length of the song.)<br>
You can pause, stop, fast forward, or rewind the song using the State Pattern.<br>
(I don't remember how the singleton pattern was used, but it is in there somewhere.)<br>
